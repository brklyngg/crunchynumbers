## Active Issues

### /app/page.tsx (Home - Project Grid)

**Issue #1**
- **Found**: "Simple, elegant tip calculator"
- **Location**: Line 23 - Just the Tip project description
- **Problem**: "Elegant" is a vague adjective that's overused in tech/design contexts. It's a generic descriptor that could apply to anything and doesn't tell users what makes this tip calculator different or better.
- **Suggestion**: "Tip calculator that splits bills by voice or text" OR "Tip calculator that works in ChatGPT—no app needed"

**Issue #2**
- **Found**: "Smart home safety solution for seniors"
- **Location**: Line 56 - Old People Safety Lamp description
- **Problem**: "Smart home" and "solution" are both tech industry buzzwords. "Solution" is particularly weak—it's marketing jargon that says nothing specific. What kind of "solution"? A device? An app? A service?
- **Suggestion**: "Fall-detection lamp that alerts family when seniors need help"

**Issue #3**
- **Found**: "Classic airhead café racer conversion with modern performance upgrades"
- **Location**: Line 15 - BMW R90/6 Street Racer description
- **Problem**: "Modern performance upgrades" is vague—what specifically is being upgraded? This could be anything from tires to a complete engine rebuild.
- **Suggestion**: "1974 BMW café racer with Brembo brakes, M-Unit electronics, and rearset pegs"

### /app/about/page.tsx (About Page)

**Issue #4**
- **Found**: "Building is my small way of making a dent in the universe."
- **Location**: Line 34
- **Problem**: "Making a dent in the universe" is a direct Steve Jobs cliché that's become overused in tech/startup culture. It's lost its impact through repetition and feels like borrowed gravitas rather than original thought.
- **Suggestion**: "Building is how I leave things better than I found them." OR "I build things that outlive me."

### /app/projects/hot-sput-summer/page.tsx

**Issue #5**
- **Found**: "A cosmic summer adventure awaits"
- **Location**: Line 23 - Project subtitle
- **Problem**: "Awaits" is passive and creates unnecessary distance. Generic adventure language doesn't convey what this actually is.
- **Suggestion**: "Retro space-age summer picnic tour" OR "Summer picnic tour inspired by 1950s space age optimism"

**Issue #6**
- **Found**: "A celebration of that brief moment when the future felt infinite and rockets pointed toward utopia"
- **Location**: Lines 52-53
- **Problem**: While poetic, this is borderline vague. "Celebration" is a weak, overused event-marketing word that doesn't specify what attendees will actually do or experience.
- **Suggestion**: "Recreating that brief moment when the future felt infinite and rockets pointed toward utopia—through atomic-age picnics, mid-century cocktails, and space-race aesthetics"

**Issue #7**
- **Found**: "Hot Sput Summer is your cosmic summer destination"
- **Location**: Line 57
- **Problem**: "Destination" is generic travel/marketing speak that's overused. Also redundant with "summer" appearing twice in close proximity.
- **Suggestion**: "Hot Sput Summer is where you belong" OR "Join us for Hot Sput Summer"

### /app/projects/truthiness/page.tsx

**Issue #8**
- **Found**: "comprehensive context"
- **Location**: Line 42
- **Problem**: "Comprehensive" is a filler adjective common in tech marketing—it's a vague intensifier that doesn't specify what kind of context users receive. How much context? What type?
- **Suggestion**: "detailed context showing sources and reasoning" OR "context including source citations and confidence scores"

**Issue #9**
- **Found**: "structured debate"
- **Location**: Line 47
- **Problem**: "Structured" is a weak modifier—almost all debates have some structure. It doesn't tell users how the debate is structured or what makes it effective.
- **Suggestion**: "adversarial debate" OR "debate following formal argumentation protocols"

**Issue #10**
- **Found**: "reliable sources"
- **Location**: Line 47
- **Problem**: "Reliable" is subjective and vague. What makes them reliable? Who determines reliability?
- **Suggestion**: "fact-check against peer-reviewed journals and primary sources" OR "cross-reference academic databases and verified news sources"

### /app/projects/bmw-r90-6-racer/page.tsx

**Issue #11**
- **Found**: "A comprehensive transformation"
- **Location**: Line 41
- **Problem**: "Comprehensive" is overused business/tech jargon that adds no specific information. It's a filler word that could be deleted entirely.
- **Suggestion**: "Complete transformation" OR just "Transformation of a 1974 BMW R90/6..."

**Issue #12**
- **Found**: "contemporary performance upgrades"
- **Location**: Lines 42-43
- **Problem**: "Contemporary" is unnecessarily formal and vague. Just say modern or specify the era of the upgrades.
- **Suggestion**: "modern performance upgrades" OR "2020s-era performance parts"

**Issue #13**
- **Found**: "modern reliability and performance"
- **Location**: Line 70
- **Problem**: Generic phrase that doesn't specify what reliability or performance improvements users can expect. What does "modern" mean here—fuel injection? Electronics? Materials?
- **Suggestion**: "electronic ignition reliability and Brembo brake performance"

**Issue #14**
- **Found**: "capable street racer"
- **Location**: Line 71
- **Problem**: "Capable" is a weak, vague adjective. Capable of what? Every working motorcycle is "capable" of something.
- **Suggestion**: "confident street racer" OR "nimble canyon carver" OR just "street racer"

**Issue #15**
- **Found**: "unique blend"
- **Location**: Line 79
- **Problem**: "Unique" is one of the most overused marketing adjectives. Technically everything is unique. It's filler that weakens the claim rather than strengthening it.
- **Suggestion**: "A 1970s BMW twin running 2020s electronics" OR just "blend of 1970s BMW engineering..."

## Summary Statistics
- **Total Active Issues**: 15
- **Pages Scanned**: 9
- **Most Common Problems**:
  - Vague adjectives (comprehensive, unique, capable, elegant, modern)
  - Marketing buzzwords (solution, destination, celebration)
  - Tech clichés (making a dent in the universe)
  - Unspecific descriptors that could apply to anything

## Notes
The copy is generally strong—concise, conversational, and free of the worst startup jargon. The main issues are scattered vague adjectives and a few instances where specificity would strengthen the claim. The ultra-minimal project pages (Scenic Route, Monocle, Safety Lamp, Tip Calculator) are actually quite good—they avoid fluff by keeping things brutally short.
